\section Content Content 

This is the development documentation for Netzhaut. It features 
- an architecture document
- a target document
- detailed descriptions of most modules including changelogs

\section Contribute Contribute
Contributing to Netzhaut is pretty simple. If you changed something in an internal library and want it to be merged into Netzhaut, make a pull request on the corresponding branch. 
So for example, if you changed something in NhECMAScript, make a pull request for the NhECMAScript branch. This will lead to changes eventually being merged into the master.
All pull requests on the master directly will be denied.

<b>NOTICE</b>
- Make sure that your code matches the code-style of Netzhaut. Some variations are ok, but no wild things. For example, function declarations should all look the same.
- Properly document non-private functions.
- Make sure that you update the corresponding Common/About.h by adding a small description of changes to the MAJOR,MINOR or PATCH version, depending on the nature of your changes.
